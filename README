# XSLT-2.0 Reference (work in progress)

This is a quick reference/cheatsheet for XSLT-2.0 elements and their
attributes: <https://pjfichet.github.io/XSLT-2.0-Reference>.

It is loosely based on the XSLT-1.0 reference by Greystate:
<https://github.com/greystate/XSLT-Reference>. But since we build the
html file from the XSLT-2.0 schema, and not from a custom handwritten
xml file, not much of that source code remains, except the html structure
and layout.

Enter `make` to build.
